    <h2>description</h2>
    <p>This recipe produces a delicious, simple egg with satisfying, set whites and a creamy, runny yolk. It's similar
        to a poached egg, but more flavorful and less fussy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons salted butter</li>

        <li> 2 large eggs</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>

        <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

        <li>1 pinch flaky sea salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dd>step 1</dd>
        <dt>Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Carefully crack eggs into the skillet and let
            cook until whites have almost set, about 1 minute.</dt>
        <dd>step 2</dd>
        <dt>Add water, cover skillet with a lid or cookie sheet, reduce heat to medium-low.</dt>
        <dd> step 3</dd>
        <dt>Let cook until whites have set, yolks are still runny, and some of white has set over yolk, 1 to 2 more
            minutes. Remove lid and transfer eggs to a serving plate. Garnish with pepper and flaky salt, if desired.
            Serve immediately.</dt>
    </dl>
