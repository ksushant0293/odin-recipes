    <p>A quick bath in boiling water gives you the perfect jammy eggs—and while your eggs cool off in the ice bath, you
        can make the sauce, which is loaded with the same ingredients you'll find in a classic seafood boil recipe.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>

        <li> ¼ cup minced white onion</li>

        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)</li>

        <li>½ cup low-sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth, or water</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dd>step 1</dd>
        <dt>Set a small pot filled halfway with water over high heat and bring to a boil. Once boiling, carefully add
            eggs and let boil for 6 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl of ice water
            and let cool 3 minutes.</dt>
        <dd>step 2</dd>
        <dt>Melt the butter in a small skillet set over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook until fragrant and
            softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and golden, about
            2 minutes. Stir in hot sauce, Old Bay seasoning, and chicken broth and cook 4 minutes, until slightly
            reduced. Remove skillet from the heat and stir in lemon juice and parsley.</dt>
        <dd>step 3</dd>
        <dt>Peel the eggs and place in a serving bowl. Pour sauce over the eggs and garnish with remaining parsley.</dt>
    </dl>
